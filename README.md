# BetterSafeBed [![](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/aUp4r9hY?label=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/staaaaaaaaaaaack) [![](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/short_484804_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-safe-bed)

This mod solves the issue of being unable to sleep even when you are safe, due to a random mob lurking in the cave beneath your base, outside its walls or on its roof.

Normally, if a "monster" is within 8 blocks horizontally and 5 blocks vertically from your bed, you will receive a message saying "You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby". This prevents you from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed.

This means that if a monster is outside your base and your bed is next to the wall, you won't be able to sleep.

To address this problem, this mod adds an extra check for mobs within range so that you can sleep peacefully even when they cannot target you.

This mod is a server-side mod, it doesn't need to install on the client to function unless you use it in singleplayer.
